## Hi there 👋 I'm Ahmet

I am a software engineer 👨‍💻 working at the intersection of AI, robotics, and language models. I enjoy experimenting with LLMs and building tools that create new things. Outside of engineering, I love creating technical content, sharing ideas, and learning something new every day.

- 🌱 I'm currently working on robotics, specifically embodied agents.  
- 🎤 I'm open to collaborations, research discussions, and speaking opportunities.  
- 💬 Ask me about Python, bio-inspired algorithms, natural language understanding, and robotics interfaces.  
- 📫 You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmet-ata%C5%9Fo%C4%9Flu/) or [HuggingFace 🤗](https://huggingface.co/atasoglu).  
- 🤭 Fun fact: I love watching mockumentaries.
